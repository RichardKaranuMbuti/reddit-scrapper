[Hiring] Bakery Website - Really Small.,"Hey everyone, I am trying to have a bakery website made. It's simplistic, well... hopefully, there is only 1 product at the moment.

For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent.

Software for online teacher and student to keep track of lessons owed?,"I work as an online freelance teacher. In most cases, students buy a package of lessons and then we book the lessons, either at the end of a lesson or using calendly. I currently keep track of the number of lessons I owe them by adding a counter in the events in google calendar. In the cases where they owe me, the counter is negative. But the students don't have access to this counter. And sometimes there may be subtle misunderstandings about the counter. For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent. Or somtimes it's a parent paying, teenagers forget lessons...

[Hiring] Bakery Website - Really Small.,"Hey everyone, I am trying to have a bakery website made. It's simplistic, well... hopefully, there is only 1 product at the moment. It's should be easy to check out and buy the products from the opening page, so I don't think this will be more than 5 pages, including some small features or needed disclaimers. I have content and pictures readily available for project as well and a base website I already attempted making to discuss things from there. I want to be clear, I am not looking to be the apple of bakeries or even the Martha Stewart or anything. I want something solid that works, that is expansive if need be, and allows me to sell my cakes soon. If this interest you we can negotiate rates and what it would take to get this job done.

Unlike Quora, where anyone can claim expertise based on reputation or points, MindMesh selects a limited number of experts per category, ensuring high-quality, reliable answers. Customers pay monthly for personalized advice in areas like finance, legal matters, business consulting, and more. Experts are grouped by category, and when a customer asks a question, all relevant experts are notified‚Äîwhichever expert responds first gains exclusive rights to answer. Initially, experts join for free to earn passive income, but as customer demand grows, MindMesh will charge experts a monthly fee for the opportunity to answer questions and generate passive income for themselves. While some may argue that AI like ChatGPT could replace this, MindMesh delivers specific, tailored answers that customers actually need‚Äîanswers that generalized AI cannot provide. With consulting and advising fees so high, customers are already paying for expertise, making this platform both valuable and necessary.",2 days ago,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotepython/comments/1my9utz/hiring_cto_for_crypto_software_startup_mind_mesh/,r/remotepython,2025-08-26 09:23:17.883628

Initially, experts join for free to earn passive income, but as customer demand grows, MindMesh will charge experts a monthly fee for the opportunity to answer questions and generate passive income for themselves. While some may argue that AI like ChatGPT could replace this, MindMesh delivers specific, tailored answers that customers actually need‚Äîanswers that generalized AI cannot provide.

[hiring] CTO For Crypto Software Startup - MIND MESH,"Mind Mesh MindMesh is a platform connecting individuals and businesses with carefully vetted experts across nearly every serious industry and topic. Unlike Quora, where anyone can claim expertise based on reputation or points, MindMesh selects a limited number of experts per category, ensuring high-quality, reliable answers. Customers pay monthly for personalized advice in areas like finance, legal matters, business consulting, and more. Experts are grouped by category, and when a customer asks a question, all relevant experts are notified‚Äîwhichever expert responds first gains exclusive rights to answer. Initially, experts join for free to earn passive income, but as customer demand grows, MindMesh will charge experts a monthly fee for the opportunity to answer questions and generate passive income for themselves. While some may argue that AI like ChatGPT could replace this, MindMesh delivers specific, tailored answers that customers actually need‚Äîanswers that generalized AI cannot provide. With consulting and advising fees so high, customers are already paying for expertise, making this platform both valuable and necessary.",2 days ago,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotepython/comments/1my9utz/hiring_cto_for_crypto_software_startup_mind_mesh/,r/remotepython,2025-08-26 09:28:53.894002

How to navigate a career in Machine learning ?,"Hey everyone, I am a 3rd-year CSE student from India.

While doing this, I have had several doubts about what is actually relevant in the current job market and what kind of projects I should focus on to land a decent internship in the field of AI and ML.
