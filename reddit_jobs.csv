[Hiring] Bakery Website - Really Small.,"Hey everyone, I am trying to have a bakery website made. It's simplistic, well... hopefully, there is only 1 product at the moment.

For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent.

Software for online teacher and student to keep track of lessons owed?,"I work as an online freelance teacher. In most cases, students buy a package of lessons and then we book the lessons, either at the end of a lesson or using calendly. I currently keep track of the number of lessons I owe them by adding a counter in the events in google calendar. In the cases where they owe me, the counter is negative. But the students don't have access to this counter. And sometimes there may be subtle misunderstandings about the counter. For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent. Or somtimes it's a parent paying, teenagers forget lessons...

[Hiring] Bakery Website - Really Small.,"Hey everyone, I am trying to have a bakery website made. It's simplistic, well... hopefully, there is only 1 product at the moment. It's should be easy to check out and buy the products from the opening page, so I don't think this will be more than 5 pages, including some small features or needed disclaimers. I have content and pictures readily available for project as well and a base website I already attempted making to discuss things from there. I want to be clear, I am not looking to be the apple of bakeries or even the Martha Stewart or anything. I want something solid that works, that is expansive if need be, and allows me to sell my cakes soon. If this interest you we can negotiate rates and what it would take to get this job done. If everything goes well I would love to expand the partnership as more work is needed and maintenance. Lastly, if this interest please email me at in your email for your header please place [Reddit, Website] so I know you read this and post any of your past work or portfolio, with hopeful citations of your work on the website in your email.
